scrollToSection.js
==================

This simple jQuery Plugin makes your website to scroll to a sections of the page when clicking links of a navigation bar.

In order to use it you only have to:

1. Include jQuery. I recommend version 1.8.2: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.min.js
2. Include the scrollToSection.js file
3. Create a navigation bar with links. 'href' property of the links should be the corresponding section to scroll to.
4. Apply the plugin to the element that contains the navigation links. E.g.: $("#main-nav").scrollToSection();
